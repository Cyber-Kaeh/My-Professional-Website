            The main point of this entire website is to give me practice with coding
            and implementing web design in a live environment. As I have been finding out,
            it is a bit different then a closed environment like just a local live server.
            It will, eventually, also be a place for me to showcase my abilities to 
            future employers. Don't worry, I'm not diluted enough to think the site is 
            ready for all that, yet. Unless you are in fact a prospective employer;
            in that case, then yes, I am incredibly talented and would love to join 
            your team.

            contact me on <a href="https://github.com/Cyber-Kaeh">GitHub</a>. I'm also
            looking for a sponsor/mentor for full stack Java development or anything
            coding related really.
